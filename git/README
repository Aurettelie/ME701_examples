This folder is populated with a file named "quote.txt" in the two branches
"gandhi" and "szasz."  That file contains a quote from Mahatma Gandhi or
Thomas Szasz, depending on the branch.  Suppose you have cloned this 
repository and are working with the master branch.  Then the following leads
to unexpected issues (but ones that can be resolved):

user@machine ~/path/to/ME701_examples $ git merge gandhi
user@machine ~/path/to/ME701_examples $ git merge szasz
